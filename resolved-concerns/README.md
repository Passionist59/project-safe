This directory stores "resolved concerns" -- basically, whenever there
is a non-obvious tradeoff, we try to create a document that describes
the tradeoff in full, and then documents the resolution we ultimately
reached. Sometimes these documents include dissents, if not everyone
agreed with the ultimate outcome. These documents can then later be
referenced if needed to recall the reasoning involved.
